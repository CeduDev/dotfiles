# Repo for dotfiles installations

Install these before running the install script:

1. [zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
2. [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
3. [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
4. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

NOTE! Make sure you've set the default shell to `zsh`, otherwise the install script won't work.
